When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

<<<<<<< HEAD
 - When you have to share the content or collaborate with other people. Problem solved.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - Because a significant change might be achieved by several commits, so there's no need to pull every single one of them. Instead, only miningful changes in the files should be shared, no matter how many commits it took. That could also help to only share a commit or commits that doesn't introduce bugs, because you may introduce one and then repair it with the next commit. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - A branch is a bifurcation of the diagram of your project, allowing you to have several versions of a file, which means making changes to a file, still having one unchanged (or modified diferently). A clone is a copy of a Github repository or a local repository into your computer (local). And a fork is a copy of a GitHub repository into your GitHub account, added as a new repository. 
 I would use a branch when I needed several versions of a file or project, in order to have one always working and other for trial changes, or different versions of the same, like translated to different changes. I would clone a repository when I needed to make local changes to files in an existing repository, leaving the original unchanged. Or when I wanted to contribute to an already existing repository. And I would use fork when I wanted to copy someone else's GitHub repository to mine's, retaining the original author's credit and not wanting to modify their actual content, just mine.
